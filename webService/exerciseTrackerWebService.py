class NotificationHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):
	'''
	Each class in here is a web handler. I name each one after whatever it happens to be handling. But that is not required
	and simply by design. You could have one hanlder that only adds stuff to the database and every post request goes to it.
	But that is annyoing to work with. So a reasonably logical design is to break everything up into entity handlers.

	There are 3 main request handlers inside of NotificationHandler: get, post, and delete. These names describe what they
	do pretty well. Get will return requested information. In this case, it returns the notification information for a
	specified user. Post will save stuff to the database. This could mean either inserting or deleteing.
	And delete will delete stuff from the database. More information can be found here (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/requesthandlerclass)
	This site is just a very shallow overview, you are better off following links off of that page/site entirely.

	As far as I can tell, self has two attributes, request and response. Generally, you 'get' from the request attribute
	and 'write' to the response attribute. More detail in the functions.

	https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/
	That is a good look to look at for NDB Datastore API information. I suggest you read at least the Overview, entities
	and keys, and properties sections.

		Here I use self.request.get to retrieve the emailAddress URL parameter from the request.
		There are two kinds of parameters we will use: URL parameters and body. URL parameters are the parameters
		that are explicitly part of the URL, everything that comes after the ?. The body is attached to the request
		and I create it from the Java side using GSON. I'll talk more about the body in the post function.

		.get looks for the parameter called emailAddress and sets its value to email. If there is no parameter
		then the default behavior is to return an empty string but you can pass another parameter to .get that is
		the default value. So if you did self.request.get('emailAddress', 'None'), if there was no emailAddress
		parameter then email would equal None.

		then I know I just want to return all of the notifications in short format for the inbox. If I do find the
		notificationId then I know I want a specific notification to return in detailed format.

			You may have noticed that I said .get after the User.query() function up in get but not here.
			That is because .query returns an iterable list of query objects, not something you can just access
			really well. So you can either do User.query().get() to return the first entry in the list (There are
				ways to get other indexes but I am not sure how). You would only really want to do this if you know
			there is going to be exactly one row returned. Otherwise you can put it into a foreach loop without the
			.get at the end. This lets you iterate through everything where notification is an actual Notification
			object and not some weird query thing.

		json.dumps is the way to write json to the response. This is because it takes json and returns a string of json.
		There is a json.dump function but that returns an actual JSON object and does not write correctly.
		Also, notice that there are {} in the .dumps function. This is the other list structure in python, dictionary.
		It is similar to map in java. You give it a string as a key and some other variable as the value

		A lot of this is a repeat of above. One thing that is different is I look for both receiverId and receiverAddress.
		This is because I am not sure what the user will send to the API. Basically, I look for receiverId first, if it
		does exist I move on, if not, then I look for the receiverAddress, use that to get the user, and then set the Id.
		It just adds a little bit of flexibility for the user.

		below is an example of using the request body to populate contents. In this we use json.loads. It is the reverse
		of json.dumps, it takes a string and returns a json object (really just a map with stuff in it). Now that I am
		looking at it, I am not sure if I need to loads and then dumps. I think it is because self.request.body is not
		written in actual characters so we need to load and then dump into an actual string object but I haven't tested
		enough to know either way. But I know this works.

		This is how you create a new entity row. Use the constructor and pass whatever variables you want to it.

		are attributes that have a default value, these can be given values but is not required, if a value is not given
		it uses the default value. Everything else needs a value or it is null. The constructor returns a key to the newly
		created object but it has not been added to the table yet. You need to call .put() to add it. This is also how you
		update rows. Call notification.query().get() to get the row, make any changes, and then call .put() to update the table.
